# Welcome to itachilee's GitHub!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm **itachilee**, a passionate software developer with a focus on **web development**, **IoT systems**, and **database management**. This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of the various projects and tools Iâ€™ve worked on, primarily utilizing modern frameworks and technologies.

## ðŸ›  Technologies I Work With

- **Frontend Development**: Vue.js, Element-Plus, and TypeScript are my go-to for creating responsive, user-friendly interfaces.
- **Backend Development**: I frequently work with .NET technologies and have built systems using **Elsa** and **SQLSugar**, an ORM designed for C#.
- **Database Management**: Iâ€™m experienced with both **SQL databases** and time-series databases like **InfluxDB**, particularly in IoT applications.
- **IoT Monitoring**: Using **InfluxDB**, I monitor devices, track their data in real-time, and create alerts for offline or abnormal data.

## ðŸ“š Projects Youâ€™ll Find Here

### 1. **Web Development Projects**
- **Vue 3 & TypeScript**: Explore projects where I implement Excel file upload and validation using modern web technologies.
- **Element-Plus**: Youâ€™ll also find user interface projects that leverage this Vue-based UI library for seamless frontend experiences.

### 2. **C# and SQLSugar Demos**
- Projects utilizing **SQLSugar** as an ORM in C# for database operations, including a demo built with **Elsa 3.2.0** for workflow automation.

### 3. **IoT Monitoring Systems**
- Projects related to **InfluxDB** for monitoring IoT devices based on points, device types, thresholds, and data anomalies.

### 4. **Backend APIs and Database Management**
- API integration projects where I connect frontend applications with backend services, ensuring data validation and smooth interaction with databases.

## ðŸŒ± Current Focus
Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into **TypeScript** and exploring new ways to integrate **Vue.js** with advanced backend technologies for real-time data monitoring.

Feel free to explore my repositories, contribute, or reach out if you have any ideas or projects in mind!

Happy coding! ðŸš€
